  ## Description
  People Net is a social network API that uses MongoDB as a NoSQL database allowing a website to handle large amounts of unstructured data. This project has Mongoose models for Users and Thoughts. It has API routes set up to GET, GET by id, POST, PUT, and DELETE Users and Thoughts allowing CRUD operations to be performed on Users and Thoughts. It also has POST and DELETE routes set up for reactions to thoughts and friends allowing the creation and deletion of reactions and friends. 

  ## Installation
  To install this project run `npm i` from the root directory which will install the necessary dependencies, including Express.js and Mongoose. 

  ## Usage
  To start the server, run `npm start`. Then the database can be accessed from Insomnia.
